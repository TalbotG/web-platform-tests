  <style>
  div
    {
      font-size: 300%;
    }

  div::selection
    {
      background-color: yellow;
      caret-color: green;
      color: black;
    }
  </style>

  <body>

  <p>Instructions: Select a few or all characters from the words "Text sample" using a variety of methods:

  <ul>
    <li>Select by dragging (leftwardedly or rightwardedly) the mouse across the characters.
    <li>Select by using shift + keyboard arrows.
    <li>Double click a word to select it.
    <li>Triple click the text to select it.
  </ul>

  <p>Test passes if, in every case, the selected characters are black, if the background color of selected characters is yellow <em>and</em> if the <strong>blinking caret is green</strong>.

  <!--
  Should I add 'while it (caret) is moving among the selected characters' ?
  I thought I should not.

  <div contenteditable="true">Text sample</div>
