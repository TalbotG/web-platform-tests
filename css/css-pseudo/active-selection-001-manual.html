  <style>
  div
    {
      color: red;
      font-size: 300%;
    }

  div::selection
    {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>

  <p>Instructions: select a few (or all) characters from the red words "Text sample". Select them with mouse dragging (leftwardedly or rightwardedly) or text-highlighting them with <kbd>Shift</kbd> and keyboard arrows when keyboard navigation (also called caret browsing) is enabled.

  <p>Reminder: you can select a whole word by double-clicking on it. You can select a whole line by triple-clicking anywhere inside it.

  <p>Test passes if the selected characters become green and if there is no background color for the characters selection.

  <div>Text sample</div>
